# Why?

Setup a clean or new Mac in a breeze with almost every tools I use daily.

## How?

Since my `zsh` profile uses [zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git) as a `git` _submodule_, clone the project using the `--recursive` flag to aumatically initialize the highligther code:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/gcauchon/dot-files.git

## Customize...

1. Edit the `.sh` scripts to customize what is needed and what is not;
2. Run each `.sh` scripts sequentially to get the job done in a breeze!

## That's it!
