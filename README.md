My dot files
=========

- zsh
- slate - https://github.com/jigish/slate
- vim - http://vim.spf13.com ~~http://code.google.com/p/macvim/~~

The basic vim configuration was replaced by the richer spf13 distribution. It looks like way too much for what I need and what I'm looking for, but weâ€™ll see how it goes!

More to come someday...
